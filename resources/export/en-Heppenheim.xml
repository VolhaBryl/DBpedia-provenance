      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1800">'''Heppenheim''' is a city in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its population is 25.400.

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the abbots of Lorsch during the early Middle Ages. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. The purpose of the keep was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the bishop of [[Bremen]]. In the 13th century Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the archbishop of [[Mainz]], and Heppenheim became a part of the [[Palatinate]].

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]]; it was conquered by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the Swedes in 1630; the [[plague]] decimated the population in 1635, and in 1645 the town was sacked by the French. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the throne of the Palatinate. Two fires in 1689 and 1693 destroyed the city completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the 18th century when the city became much of its present look. In 1803 the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around 1900, among them the cathedral of Saint Peter (1904), the Protestant church (1888) and the synagogue (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

'''Heppenheim''' is a city in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its population is 25.400.  It is accessed by routes [[German route 3|3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]en [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[bishop]] of [[Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], and Heppenheim became a part of the [[Palatinate]].

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]]; it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. Two fires in [[1689]] and [[1693]] destroyed the city completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

'''Heppenheim''' is a city in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its population is 25.400.  It is accessed by routes [[German route 3|3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]en [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[bishop]] of [[Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], who pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the french troops, destroyed the city almost completely. 

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Hesse-Darmstadt]].

'''Heppenheim''' is a city in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its population is 25.400.  It is accessed by routes [[German route 3|3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]en [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[bishop]] of [[Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], who pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the french troops, destroyed the city almost completely. 

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the french troops, destroyed the city almost completely. 

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]].

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], who pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with [[West Bend]], who send their German languge students to Heppenheim and vice versa.

In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with [[West Bend]], who send their German language students to Heppenheim and vice versa.

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], who pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], who pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]].

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[German route 460|460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[A5 autobahn|A5]] and [[A67 autobahn|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], who pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located here. It provided [[slave labour]] for the [[Deustche Versuchanstalt]] (German Research Institute).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with [[West Bend]], who send their German language students to Heppenheim and vice versa.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]).

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located here. It provided [[slave labour]] for the [[Deustche Versuchanstalt]] (German Research Institute).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with [[West Bend]], who send their German language students to Heppenheim and vice versa.

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[Bundesstraße 460|B460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] and [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishop]] of [[Mainz]], who pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]) and the electrical power plant in neo gotic style providing electricity using steam engines ([[1899]]).

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located here. It provided [[slave labour]] for the [[Deustche Versuchanstalt]] (German Research Institute).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[Bundesstraße 460|B460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] and [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishopric of Mainz]]; it pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]) and the electrical power plant in neo gotic style providing electricity using steam engines ([[1899]]).

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located here. It provided [[slave labour]] for the [[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt]] (German Research Institute).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with [[West Bend, Wisconsin]], who send their German language students to Heppenheim and vice versa.

[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[Bundesstraße 460|B460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] and [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]].

The city was founded about [[755]] in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In [[1065]] the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in [[1066]] it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the [[13th century]] Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishopric of Mainz]]; it pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in [[1461]] and redeemed the pledge [[1623]]/[[1650]].

A fire in [[1369]] destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in [[1621]], and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in [[1630]]; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in [[1635]], and in [[1645]] the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in [[1693]], caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the [[18th century]] when the city acquired much of its present look. In [[1803]] the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around [[1900]], among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter ([[1904]]), the [[Protestant]] church ([[1888]]) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of [[1938]]) and the electrical power plant in neo-gothic style providing electricity using steam engines ([[1899]]).

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located here. It provided [[slave labour]] for the [[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt]] (German Research Institute).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Free Democratic Party of Germany]] was founded in Heppenheim ([[1949]]).

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with [[West Bend, Wisconsin]], who send their German language students to Heppenheim and vice versa.

'''Heppenheim''' is a [[city]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is situated at the edge of the [[Odenwald]] mountains and is the capital of the [[Bergstraße]] district. Its [[population]] is 25,400.  It is accessed by routes [[Bundesstraße 3|B3]] and [[Bundesstraße 460|B460]] and [[autobahn]]s [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] and [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]].

The city was founded about 755 in the vicinity of the then powerful monastery of [[Lorsch]]. The young town was ruled by the [[abbot]]s of Lorsch during the early [[Middle Ages]]. In 1065 the ''Starkenburg'' was built, a castle above the city. Its purpose was to protect the town and the monastery from invaders; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|bishop of Bremen]]. In the 13th century Lorsch and Heppenheim were acquired by the [[archbishopric of Mainz]]; it pawned Heppenheim to the count of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in 1461 and redeemed the pledge 1623/1650.

A fire in 1369 destroyed the whole city except 4 houses.

Heppenheim severely suffered in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); it was conquered by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630; the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] decimated the population in 1635, and in 1645 the town was sacked by the [[France|French]]. After the end of the war French troops continued to devastate the region, due to their king's claim to the Palatinate. A fire in 1693, caused by the French troops, destroyed the city almost completely.

Rebuilding started in the beginning of the 18th century when the city acquired much of its present look. In 1803 the clerical states of Germany were abolished, and Heppenheim fell to [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. The new province was called &quot;[[Starkenburg]]&quot;, and this name is sometimes even today applied to the entire region.

The largest buildings of the city were built around 1900, among them the [[cathedral]] of Saint Peter (1904), the [[Protestant]] church (1888) and the [[synagogue]] (1900, destroyed in the [[Kristallnacht|pogrom night]] of 1938) and the electrical power plant in neo-gothic style providing electricity using steam engines (1899).

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located here. It provided [[slave labour]] for the [[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt]] (German Research Institute).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Archbishop of Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The community’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Archbishop of Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The community’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Archbishop of Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium 
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Archbishop of Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===

Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Archbishop of Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Archbishop of Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag''

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

* ''Internationales Straßentheater beim Festival Gassensensationen'' (Street theatre, early July)
* ''Fastnachtsumzug'' ([[Carnival]] parade)
* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium 
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 350 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]shof''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===
[[Image:Heppenheim Rathaus RZ.jpg|thumb|Town Hall on the Marketplace]]
[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium 
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were already [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803, repeated ecclesiastical measures were undertaken to persecute Jews. In the persecution during the time of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349, Jewish life in the town was wiped out. The founding of the modern community goes back to the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families with 200 to 300 persons living in town. The figure fell to 113 persons by 1933 as a result of migration and emigration. The best known Jew was the Honorary Professor of Religious Sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Martin Buber]]. In February 1938, he felt forced to leave the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9 November 1938) his house was looted and his 3,000-book library was destroyed. In May 1939, 37 Jews were still living in town. In September 1942, Heppenheim’s last few Jewish residents were deported. At the former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, is found a stone plaque with the outline of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. It bears the inscription: ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Here stood the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). A further plaque headed ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists 29 former Heppenheim Jews’ names. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “euthanasia” crimes, and indeed also was a so-called “gathering facility” for Jewish psychiatric patients, that is to say, a halfway station on the way to the [[Gas chamber|gas ovens]].

From 28 May 1942, Heppenheim hosted a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp. It was closed on 18 December 1942 but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were set to working in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 18 to 27 June 2004, Heppenheim hosted the yearly ''Hessentag'', an event which should show the different regions in Hesse.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Regular events ===
Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)

* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium 
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===

Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
In the outlying centre of Ober-Hambach is found the ''Odenwald-Schule'', the oldest German [[comprehensive school]] (''Gesamtschule'') on an educational reform plan. It was opened in 1910 by Edith and Paul Geheeb. It was supposed to combine “handwork” with “headwork”. Today the [[boarding school]] houses up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===
The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===
[[Image:Heppenheim Rathaus RZ.jpg|thumb|Town Hall on the Marketplace]]
[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|-----
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-----

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

* ''Fastnachtsumzug'' ([[Carnival]] parade)
* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium 
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Regular events ===
Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Vettelheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Vettelheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

Also, after the 14th of November, the town was renamed 'Vettelheim' because of the homegrown Formula One 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, who brought out Heppenheim on the map.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium 
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

Also, after the 14th of November 2010, the town was renamed 'Vettelheim' because of the homegrown Formula One 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, who brought out Heppenheim on the map.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|-----
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-----
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-----
| since 1&amp;nbsp;September 2005 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

Also, after the 14th of November 2010, the town was renamed 'Vettelheim' because of the homegrown Formula One 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, who brought out Heppenheim on the map.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

Also, after the 14th of November 2010, the town was renamed 'Vettelheim' because of the homegrown Formula One 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, who brought out Heppenheim on the map.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field. It is the town where 2010 Formula One World Champion Sebastien Vettel Lived

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

Also, after the 14th of November 2010, the town was renamed 'Vettelheim' because of the homegrown Formula One 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, who brought out Heppenheim on the map.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

Also, after the 14th of November 2010, the town was renamed 'Vettelheim' because of the homegrown Formula One 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, who brought out Heppenheim on the map.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===
The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

Also, after the 14th of November 2010, the town was renamed 'Vettelheim' because of the homegrown Formula One 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel, who brought out Heppenheim on the map.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|-----
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|----
| since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach(CDU)

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|----

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. [[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|-----

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the [[France|French]] in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by [[Spain|Spanish]] troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the [[France|French]].

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|Martin Buber's house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by [[United States|American]] troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|-----

|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]] since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], [[France]] since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]] since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of [[German language|German]] to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of [[French language|French]].

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Regular events ===
Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)
* ''Internationales Weinmarkt-Stockschießturnier'' (international wine market and [[ice stock sport]] tournament, second weekend during wine market)

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from [[North America]] but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|Martin Buber's house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;ha of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The ''Odenwaldschule'', Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|-----

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[Image:Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office

|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Regular events ===
Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)
* ''Internationales Weinmarkt-Stockschießturnier'' (international wine market and [[ice stock sport]] tournament, second weekend during wine market)

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-

|-

|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local South Hessian dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===
The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office

|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)
* ''Internationales Weinmarkt-Stockschießturnier'' (international wine market and [[ice stock sport]] tournament, second weekend during wine market)

* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-

| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===
The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-

|-

|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-

|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-

| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-

|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

* ''Internationales Straßentheater beim Festival Gassensensationen'' (Street theatre, early July)
* ''Fastnachtsumzug'' ([[Carnival]] parade)
* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim [[railway station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office
! Mayor
|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

== Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===

Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''Hessentag'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim was the 2004 host of ''[[Hessentag]]'', an annual event in Hesse, featuring the different regions of the state.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to [[Electoral Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with [[Electoral Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-

|-

|-

|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office
! Mayor
|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn

|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===
[[Image:Heppenheim Rathaus RZ.jpg|thumb|Town Hall on the Marketplace]]
[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office
! Mayor
|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)

* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-

|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===
The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==
=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office

|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

=== Sightseeing ===
[[Image:Heppenheim Rathaus RZ.jpg|thumb|Town Hall on the Marketplace]]
[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)

* ''Internationales Straßentheater beim Festival Gassensensationen'' (Street theatre, early July)
* ''Fastnachtsumzug'' ([[Carnival]] parade)
* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')
* Kreisvolkshochschule (district [[folk high school]])
* Haus am Maiberg (political and social training centre of the Diocese of Mainz)

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office

|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

=== Sightseeing ===
[[Image:Heppenheim Rathaus RZ.jpg|thumb|Town Hall on the Marketplace]]
[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:

|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-

| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration. 

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Town council ===
The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)

* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration.

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-

|-

|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

=== Sightseeing ===
[[Image:Heppenheim Rathaus RZ.jpg|thumb|Town Hall on the Marketplace]]
[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration.

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-

|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-

|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-

|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-

|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.

[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration.

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office
! Mayor
|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

=== Sightseeing ===
[[Image:Heppenheim Rathaus RZ.jpg|thumb|Town Hall on the Marketplace]]
[[Image:20060408-Heppenheim Marktplatz Starkenburg.jpg|thumb|Marketplace and Starkenburg in the background]]
[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Regular events ===
Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)
* ''Internationales Weinmarkt-Stockschießturnier'' (international wine market and [[ice stock sport]] tournament, second weekend during wine market)
* ''Internationales Straßentheater beim Festival Gassensensationen'' (Street theatre, early July)
* ''Fastnachtsumzug'' ([[Carnival]] parade)
* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)
* ''Kirchweih'' (church consecration festival, first weekend in August)
* Regular events by ''Forum Kultur''

=== Starkenburg Observatory ===
The ''[[Starkenburg Observatory|Starkenburg-Sternwarte]]'', an amateur observatory on the Schlossberg near the Starkenburg, has made a name for itself nationally in [[minor planet]] research.

=== Museums and cultural institutions ===
* Museum für Stadtgeschichte und Volkskunde (town history and folklore)
* Konservatorium
* “Theater im Hof” of the “Festspiele Heppenheim GmbH” (organizer of the ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'')
* Kreisvolkshochschule (district [[folk high school]])
* Haus am Maiberg (political and social training centre of the Diocese of Mainz)

=== Clubs in Heppenheim ===

* FC Sportfreunde Heppenheim e.&amp;nbsp;V.
* REC Heppenheim e.&amp;nbsp;V.; ice stock sport
* HC VfL Heppenheim; [[team handball]]

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration.

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

In 1948 the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] was founded in Heppenheim.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! Time in office
! Mayor
|-
| 1821–1842 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1843–1852 || Georg Neff
|-
| 1853–1863 || Gottfried Piersch
|-
| 1864–1869 || Georg Hamel
|-
| 1870–1874 || Johann Friedrich Weis
|-
| 1874–1887 || Lorenz Keßler
|-
| 1887–1910 || Wilhelm Höhn
|-
| 1910–1913 || Ludwig Lorenz Kohl
|-
| 1914–1924 || Anton Philipp Wiegand
|-
| 1925–1937 || Dr. Karl Schiffers (Zentrum/NSDAP)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1937–1945 || Dr. Walter Köhler (NSDAP)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1945 || Dr. Gustav König&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1945–1946 || Jakob Fleck (SPD)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1946–1948 || Karl Hagen (CDU)
|-
| 1948–1954 || Otto Holzamer (FDP)
|-
| 1954–1973 || Wilhelm Metzendorf (independent)
|-
| 1973–1987 || Hans Kunz (CDU)
|-
| 1987–2005 || Ulrich Obermayr (CDU)
|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

=== Town partnerships ===
Partnership arrangements exist with the following towns:
*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Kaltern an der Weinstraße]]/Caldaro sulla Strada del Vino, [[South Tyrol]], Italy since 18 September 1971
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], France since 12 April 1975
*{{flagicon|United States}} [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], [[Wisconsin]], USA since 19 June 2004

Every year, Heppenheim exchanges students with West Bend, and with Le Chesnay, which sends its students of German to Heppenheim, which sends Le Chesnay its students of French.

=== Sponsorship ===
Since 1956, together with the town of [[Bubenreuth]], there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to [[Luby (Cheb District)|Luby]], formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the [[Sudetenland]] (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

=== Sightseeing ===

[[Image:Heppenheim Altstadt 01.jpg|thumb|The centre of Heppenheim’s Old Town seen from the Starkenburg]]
[[Image:Heppenheim St Peter 02.jpg|thumb|The “Cathedral of the Bergstraße”, St. Peter’s Church]]
Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses and ''Marienbrunnen'' (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Parish Church of  St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amtshof]]''
* Former power station built in 1899 in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vhvheppenheim.de/freilichtbuehne.html |title=Freilichtbühne (Geschichte und Gegenwart) |publisher=Vhvheppenheim.de |date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

=== Regular events ===
Important yearly events are:
* ''Heppenheimer Festspiele'' (festival, daily from mid to late July to early September)
* ''Bergsträßer Weinmarkt'' (wine market, late June)
* ''Internationales Weinmarkt-Stockschießturnier'' (international wine market and [[ice stock sport]] tournament, second weekend during wine market)
* ''Internationales Straßentheater beim Festival Gassensensationen'' (Street theatre, early July)
* ''Fastnachtsumzug'' ([[Carnival]] parade)
* ''Ferienspiele für Kinder von Vorschule bis 16 Jahren'' (children’s summer holiday games, preschool to 16)

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

'''Heppenheim (Bergstraße)''' is the seat of [[Bergstraße (district)|Bergstraße district]] in [[Hesse]], Germany, lying on the [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]] on the edge of the [[Odenwald]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is romantically set on gentle vineyards below the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is ''St. Peter'', the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop’s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' 3 and 460, and [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 5|A&amp;nbsp;5]]/[[Bundesautobahn 67|A&amp;nbsp;67]], almost halfway between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Darmstadt]], in southern Hesse on the boundary with [[Baden-Württemberg]], and is Hesse’s southernmost district seat.
[[File:Heppenheim-luftbild.jpg|thumb|links|Aerial photography]]
[[File:Heppenheim von oben.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim seen from the Starkenburg castle]]
The town’s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Palatinate German  dialect, the town is also called ''Hepprum''.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the [[Rhine rift]] (now ''Bundesstraße'' 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town’s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of [[Bensheim]], in the northeast on the community of [[Lautertal (Odenwald)|Lautertal]] and the town of [[Lindenfels]], in the east on the communities of [[Fürth (Odenwald)|Fürth]], [[Rimbach (Odenwald)|Rimbach]], [[Mörlenbach]] and [[Birkenau (Odenwald)|Birkenau]], in the south on the community of [[Laudenbach (Bergstraße)|Laudenbach]] ([[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]), in the southwest on the towns of [[Viernheim]] and [[Lampertheim]] and in the west on the town of [[Lorsch]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a [[Franks|Frankish]] domain. In 773, this area became one of [[Charlemagne]]’s donations to the [[Lorsch Abbey]], and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by the [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], [[Archbishop of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]].  The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory’s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey’s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich II]] put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Electoral Mainz]], doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'' in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt]], and since 1948 it has been part of the [[States of Germany|''Bundesland'']] of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (''Oberamt'') of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the ''Amt'' was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) ''Amt'', and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (''Landratsbezirk''). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the [[Kreis Bergstraße|Bergstraße district]], to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the [[Rhine]]’s right bank being added after the [[Second World War]].

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the [[Nine Years' War]]), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the [[United States|Americans]] marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1630. The [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the [[Poland|Poles]] in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (''Heppenheimer Tagung''), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the ''Halber Mond'' (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German Revolution]] in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP, ''Freie Demokratische Partei'') was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were [[Jew]]s living in Heppenheim by the [[Middle Ages]]. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration.

[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]'s house (1916–38) in Heppenheim, Germany. Now the headquarters of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]].]]
[[Martin Buber]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] and honorary professor of religious sciences at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], is the best known Jewish son of Heppenheim. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to [[Jerusalem]]. On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], Buber's house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue’s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, ''Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.'' (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title ''Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten'' (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] “[[Aktion T4|euthanasia]]” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the [[gas chamber]].

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/[[Natzweiler-Struthof]] concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] institution ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung''.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th [[Hessentag]] state festival.

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

=== Mayors ===
In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor’s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

|-

|-
| 2005–2011 || Gerhard Herbert (SPD)
|-
|since 1 September 2011 || Rainer Burelbach (CDU) 
|}

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Schiffers switched to the NSDAP to keep abreast of changes, but he soon ran into difficulties with the Party and thereby lost his office in 1937.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. Köhler was in the mayor’s office only until 1941 when he was called into the Wehrmacht. His duties were performed by deputy Franz Keil during his absence. Despite party membership, Dr. Köhler is said not to have been a fanatical Nazi, but rather a respectable mayor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Dr. König and Jakob Fleck were each provisionally appointed mayor after the Americans marched in 1945.&lt;/small&gt;

Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers’s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] are [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]d with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arrms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) is the Lorsch Abbey’s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) is the silver six-spoked [[wheel of Mainz]] on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], symbolize the town’s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town’s time with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz’s hegemony.

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim’s destruction in the Nine Years' War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong [[Rhine Neckar Area]] and together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal) is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area’s and the Starkenburg Region’s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population’s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===
[[Image:Bahnhof Heppenheim 01.jpg|thumb|Heppenheim [[railway station]] in June 2007]]
Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. [[Heppenheim (Bergstr) station|Heppenheim station]] is found in the town centre, and the two-track [[Main-Neckar Railway]] links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe’s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the [[Second World War]], many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the [[Hessische Bergstraße]] wine region. With some 450&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] of vineyards it was originally Germany’s smallest self-contained wine region (but since [[German reunification|Reunification]] it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is [[Riesling]]. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG coöperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse’s biggest wine cellar. The ''Bergsträßer Staatsweingut'' (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the ''Hessischer Rebmuttergarten'' (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the [[phylloxera]], introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9&amp;nbsp;km-long ''Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein'' (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The [[Odenwaldschule]], Germany's oldest [[comprehensive school]], is in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of [[holistic]] education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. Today, the [[boarding school]] has up to 250 pupils.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.
